# My First HTML Project üéâ

Welcome to my very first HTML project! After 2 days of learning HTML, I've created this website to showcase what I've learned so far.

## What I've Learned

In just 2 days, I've discovered the fundamentals of HTML:

- **HTML Structure**: Understanding how to create the basic skeleton of a webpage with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags
- **Text Elements**: Using headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and text formatting
- **Links**: Creating navigation with anchor tags (`<a>`) to connect pages
- **Images**: Adding visual content with the `<img>` tag
- **Lists**: Organizing information with ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists
- **Basic Semantic Elements**: Learning about `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and other meaningful tags

## Project Features

This project includes:
- A clean, simple homepage
- Basic navigation structure
- Properly formatted text content
- Images and links
- Semantic HTML elements for better accessibility

## What's Next?

My learning journey continues! Next up:
- CSS for styling and layout
- Making the site responsive
- Adding interactive elements with JavaScript
- Learning about web accessibility best practices

## Getting Started

To view this project:
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Explore the different pages and content!

## Tools Used

- HTML5
- Any text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)
- Web browser for testing

## Reflection

Starting with HTML has been an exciting journey! Even with just 2 days of learning, I can already see how websites are built from the ground up. The logical structure of HTML makes sense, and I'm looking forward to adding styling and interactivity to make this project even better.

## Acknowledgments
